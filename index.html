  <h2>What I've worked on</h2>

  <p>
    I got into programming in 2016. I developed a web application for <a href="https://www.continentalmabor.pt" target="_blank">Continental</a> to manage bulk raw materials.
    I used <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> and I was totally convinced. It was my first professional experience and I was able to accomplish all goals due to its productivity.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2017, I started working at <a href="https://www.talkdesk.com" target="_blank">Talkdesk</a>. I was part of the team that developed the first Developer Portal app.
    We used <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> for the API and <strong>React</strong> for the frontend.
  </p>

  <p>
    Later, I joined a small team that built <a href="https://www.talkdesk.com/contact-center-platform/workspace/" target="_blank">Workspace</a>, a microfrontend engine that
    coordinated 30 plus apps built by different teams and technologies. We used vanilla <strong>JavaScript</strong>, a lot of <i>iframes</i> and <i>postMessage</i> and a bit of <strong>React</strong>. This environment was available
    both on web and desktop without any code change from the teams building the apps. We used <strong>Electron</strong> for that.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently, I'm working at <a href="https://shape.construction" target="_blank">Shape Construction</a>. We have a <strong>React</strong> PWA application backed by a <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> API.
    My main focus has been in reducing the amount of state we manage in the frontend, migrating the app from <strong>Redux</strong> to <strong>React Query</strong>. This improved the application reliability and
    also the development experience. We are doing more with less code.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the same time, I implement new endpoints on the API as well as extending existing ones. As an example, I helped migrating our <strong>Active Storage</strong> files to a different cloud provider without downtime.
    Also, I extended our existing comment feature to support commenting on other entities.

  <h2>Why me</h2>

  <p>
    I'm eager to learn more about programming, specially Ruby on Rails. The things you share online about how you tackle problems make me want to know more.
    There's a habit in our industry that leads you into management after some time. I don't want that. I don't want to be stuck in <strong>meetings all day</strong> and feel nothing gets done.
    I want to express my creativity by building good, simple products that make people's lives easier and smile.
  </p>

  <p>
    But I'm also a good manager: <strong>a manager of myself</strong>. I can get things done. I don't pull all-nighters and I take work for what it is: just work. But I'm proud of what I do and I want to do it well.
  </p>

  <p>
    As an example, during the first days of the COVID-19 pandemic, I led the development of a volunteer website with eCommerce tutorials for the digital literacy challenged. It had 150K plus visits, 27 references in the Portuguese media with a 500K plus reach.
    With the team assistance, the project ended up being replicated in Brazil.

  <p>
    I read all your books more than once and every detail ressonates with me on a deep level. I want to be part of that too.
    One of the reasons I changed to my current company was exactly because they followed Shape Up and I wanted to see it practice.
