  <h2>What I've worked on</h2>

  <h3>Continental 2016 - 2016</h3>
  <p>
    I developed a web application for <a href="https://www.continentalmabor.pt" target="_blank">Continental</a> to manage bulk raw materials.
    I used <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> and I was totally convinced. It was my first professional experience and I was able to accomplish all goals due to its productivity.
  </p>

  <h3>Blip 2016 - 2017</h3>
  <p>
    Working with AngularJS, I was part of the team that rebuilt <a href="https://www.paddypower.com" target="_blank">Paddy Power</a> desktop and mobile applications from scratch using Betfair platform and infrastructure.
  </p>

  <h3>Talkdesk 2017 - 2021</h3>
  <p>
    In 2017, I started working at <a href="https://www.talkdesk.com" target="_blank">Talkdesk</a>. I was part of the team that developed the first Developer Portal app.
    We used <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> for the API and <strong>React</strong> for the frontend.
  </p>

  <p>
    Later, I joined a small team that built <a href="https://www.talkdesk.com/contact-center-platform/workspace/" target="_blank">Workspace</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Microfrontend engine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Running 30+ apps built by different teams and technologies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Written in vanilla <strong>JavaScript</strong>, a lot of <i>iframes</i> and <i>postMessage</i> and a bit of <strong>React</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Available both on web and desktop without any code change from the teams building the apps. We used <strong>Electron</strong> for that.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Shape Construction 2021 - now</h3>
  <p>
    Currently, I'm working at <a href="https://shape.construction" target="_blank">Shape Construction</a>. We have a <strong>React</strong> PWA application backed by a <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> API.
    My main focus initially was to reduce the amount of state we manage in the frontend, migrating the app from <strong>Redux</strong> to <strong>React Query</strong>. This improved the application reliability and
    also the development experience. We are doing more with less code.
  </p>

  <p>
    For one year now, I shifted more into backend work and I'm working on our Rails API. Some examples of work I've done so far:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Migrate our Active Storage files to a different cloud provider without downtime.
      </li>
      <li>
        Extend our existing comment feature to support commenting on other entities.
      </li>
      <li>
        Develop new product to allow our users to create and manage weekly work plans for construction sites, with features like exporting to PDF via email, attaching photos, linking to other entities in the system.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Why me</h2>

  <p>
    I'm eager to learn more about programming, specially Ruby on Rails. The things you share online about how you tackle problems make me want to know more.
    There's a habit in our industry that leads you into management after some time. I don't want that. I don't want to be stuck in <strong>meetings all day</strong> and feel nothing gets done.
    I want to express my creativity by building good, simple products that make people's lives easier and smile.
  </p>

  <p>
    But I'm also a good manager: <strong>a manager of myself</strong>. I can get things done. I don't pull all-nighters and I take work for what it is: just work. But I'm proud of what I do and I want to do it well.
  </p>

  <p>
    As an example, during the first days of the COVID-19 pandemic, I led the development of a volunteer website with eCommerce tutorials for the digital literacy challenged. It had 150K plus visits, 27 references in the Portuguese media with a 500K plus reach.
    With the team assistance, the project ended up being replicated in Brazil.
  </p>

    <figcaption>One of the detail pages, with YouTube tutorials.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    I read all your books more than once and every detail ressonates with me on a deep level. I want to be part of that too.
    One of the reasons I changed to my current company was exactly because they followed Shape Up and I wanted to see it in practice.
  </p>

  <p>
    I got into this career thanks to Ruby on Rails. I'm by no means an expert as I made some detours lately into the world of React and single page applications.
    But seeing Hey and Campfire coming into shape and your latest developments in Basecamp, I know I want to be back into the calm and productive world of Rails.
    And I would like to learn with the ones that created it. Every sneak peek that David and the team share about how you program and approach software, makes me want to learn how to achieve that level of simplicity and beauty.
    Or on the design side of things, ending up adding just a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j74mQ_dDmuI" target="_blank">CSS class</a> when you could have taken the complex route.
